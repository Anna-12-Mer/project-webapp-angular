# HackYourFuture - project web app scaffolding

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## Getting started
Take a look at the existing component, students and teachers. Then, fork the repo to get started yourself. Delete teachers, home and students components and service.

## Material
We've pre-installed [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/). This comes with some [themes out of the box](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming), which you can chose from `./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes`. Whenever you want to style something, first checkout whether material has a component for it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.
